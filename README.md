# **Project Overview**

This Power BI dashboard solves the problem of scattered and hard-to-understand personal finance data. It brings transactions, budgets, account balances and savings goals into one place so it is easy to see where money is going, spot overspending, and track savings progress toward important goals like an emergency fund or a new car.

In summary, this dashboard helps to move from financial uncertainty to a state of clarity and control. 

# Data Cleaning and Preparation

🔹 **Data Preparation & Transformation**

- Cleaned and transformed the raw data using Power Query to improve data quality and ensure it was reliable for analysis and reporting.
- Created DAX measures to calculate key financial indicators, including income, expenses, investments, savings progress, savings targets, and account balances across both accounts.
- Used external design resources to enhance usability and visual clarity, including icons from [icons8.com](https://icons8.com), logo from [freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com/search?format=search&last_filter=query&last_value=blue+Saving+text+logo&query=blue+Saving+text+logo) and credit card visual created with [postermywall.com](https://www.postermywall.com/index.php/posters/search?s=bank+card&safe_content=safe)
- Selected and applied a consistent colour palette to improve visual accuracy, readability, and overall user experience across the dashboard.
- created a dedicated calendar table to enable accurate time-based analysis and reporting.

# Insights

2025 was a good year for me; I earned well. ₦34.3m came in. But almost as quickly, ₦30.9m went back out. I wasn’t reckless, but I wasn’t relaxed either. I was living comfortably close to the edge. Investing ₦8.4m was very important. It showed discipline. Still, I couldn’t help asking myself if I could have done better with tighter control.

When I looked month by month, patterns jumped out. Some months I stayed on track. Other months, spending quietly spiked. Rent, fuel, shopping, and utilities were the usual suspects. Nothing dramatic. Just habits adding up.

The transaction details made it even clearer. I leaned heavily on cash and USSD. Fast. Convenient. Easy to lose track of. The same merchants kept showing up, proof that my spending wasn’t random. It was routine.

My savings goals told a mixed story. The emergency fund was over halfway done, which felt reassuring. The car and vacation goals were moving, but slower than planned. Progress, yes. Momentum, not quite.

By the end of the year, the message was simple.
” I’m earning enough. I’m saving and investing. “
But if I tighten everyday spending, especially the repeated ones, I move from “doing okay” to being fully in control.
